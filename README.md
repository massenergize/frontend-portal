## Welcome to MassEnergize's Community Portal!

üåç **MassEnergize** is on a mission to tackle the climate emergency head-on! We work with community organizers and local leaders to supercharge household and community-level climate actions. Our open-source Frontend portal is a crucial part of this mission, and we need YOU to join our team of eco-warriors!

**The Situation:** Mother Earth's throwing some serious shade our way (literally, with all this heat). We need a code-powered climate crusade!

**The Frontend Team's Mission:** We're the user experience champions, building intuitive interfaces that make climate action accessible and engaging. We translate the power of the backend's APIs into user-friendly tools, empowering everyday people to become climate warriors. Every click, swipe, and tap adds up to a world of difference!
